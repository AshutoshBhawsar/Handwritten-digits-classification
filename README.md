# Handwritten-digits-classification

- Implemented MLP Neural Network from scratch to classify handwritten digits from MNIST dataset 
- Used Feed Forward and Back Propagation to implement Neural Network
- Experimented the effect of `regularization` in the `bias-variance` trade-off
- Used the same neural network for more challenging face dataset and compared it with `Deep Neural Network` and `Convolutional Neural Network` using the Tensorflow library
